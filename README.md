# Celeritas.JS
### Easy JS physics


## What is this?
celeritas.js is a JavaScript library designed for easy 2D game development on the HTML5 `<canvas>` element.  It was inspired by [LÃ–VE](//love2d.org),
>an \*awesome* framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua. It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

Rather than being something like [Box2D.js](https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js/) or [PhysicsJS](http://wellcaffeinated.net/PhysicsJS/), celeritas.js aims to be an easy way to create games in JavaScript and HTML5, especially for beginners.

## Features
The library is designed for easy use for any JavaScript level of expertise.  As such, objects created by it have intuitive function properties (e.g. `Body.prototype.setLinearVelocity(xV, yV)`).  As this project gets older, we plan to create more advanced features.
## Current Features
- Objects
	- Circles
	- Squares
	- Rectangles
- Collision
- Gravity
- Velocity
- Body update
## Planned Features
- Nothing yet - suggest some in the [Issues](https://github.com/Firedrake969/celeritas.js/issues)!
### Documentation
No documentation yet.  It will be put in the wiki or gh-pages when I get around to beginning it.

## Notes
Code with commented links means that I adapted code from StackOverflow.  If you're the original author, feel free to contact me to remove the section of code - I will replace it with something achieving the same purpose but (hopefully) different enough.
